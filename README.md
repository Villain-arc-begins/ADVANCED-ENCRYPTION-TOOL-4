  ## Overview of the Project
  The project is a **ADVANCED ENCRYPTION TOOL** to develop a user-friendly file encryption and decryption toolkit that uses the AES-256 encryption algorithm to 
  securely protect sensitive files to ensure the confidentiality of the file witha password protection.
  ## key features
**1 AES-256 Encryption for Strong Security:**

This project employs the AES-256 algorithm, one of the most reliable and secure methods available, to ensure that your files remain confidential and protected from unauthorized access.

**2 Password-Based Key Protection:**

A unique cryptographic key is generated from your password using PBKDF2 with SHA-256. This, along with a random salt, makes the encryption process highly secure and resistant to brute-force attacks.

**3 Secure and Unique Encryption for Every File:**

Each file is encrypted with its unique randomly generated initialization vector (IV), so even if you encrypt the same file twice, the outcome will be different 
every time.

**4 Simple file decryption**

Decrypt your files safely through the same password; it brings those files to their original state with no lost data.
More security involves random salt and IV 
Randomly generated salt as well as IV makes your encrypted files even harder to crack, with a stronger layer of protection.

**5 Handles Any File Size:**

The tool uses PKCS7 padding to seamlessly work with files of any size, thus it is compatible with the AES encryption process.

**6 User-Friendly Interface:**

The project includes an easy-to-use graphical interface, which is built using tkinter. The following can be done with this tool:
Enter your password and Select files for encryption or decryption then View clear success or error messages.

**7 Files Organized:**

The encrypted files get saved safely by using a ".enc" extension, and restored in original format the decrypted file is so that you always know
